## Decentralized

Hymn sheet is a decentralize web application its core technologies are IPFS, IPFS PubSub and IPNS. It might be described as a Web 3.0 application.

## Why

Jesus is a strong advocate of decentralization:

- He said "You are the salt of the earth" - salt acts in a decentralized way
- many think if they were in charge they could fix the world, Jesus says "Love your neighbor"
- the disciples complained, a man not one of us, is teaching our message shall we stop him? Jesus said let him keep going
- Jesus said those that have his Spirit are like the wind no one knows where they come from or are going

Hymn sheet was built to allow large groups to worship in the open air. It should be as easy as posting on Twitter I am going up on Carlton Hill to worship Thursday evening at 8pm come and join me. This requires people with boldness. Jesus says:

> Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.

You are encouraged to give it a try and post the results (we have an issue open for this just add comments and links to videos). This is an early release of this software and we need people to test it out and let us know their experience we will continue to improve the UX and to fix issues.

The aim is for this to be a polished app in time for singing carols around the world this Christmas.

## Thanks

Hymn sheet began at the Hack FS hackathon thanks to everyone who helped by answering questions.
